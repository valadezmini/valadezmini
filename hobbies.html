            <br><h3>I started working out in late 2021 with my friends in a garage. Eventually in April of 2022, we started to work out at our local YMCA and soon we much preferred it to our garage gym. I really like to work out because it is just overall good for me and I get to spend time with my friends.</h3>

            <br><h3>I started martial arts when I was five years old. I started because my Dad had already been doing it for a couple of years and I thought it was interesting. I have been training for about nine and a half years now and am a 1st degree black belt. I train to bond with my Dad and really just have strong moral values as our style is much more focused on the philosophical and mental side of martial arts. </h3>
